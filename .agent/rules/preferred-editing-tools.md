# Preferred File Editing Tools

## Overview
This rule mandates the use of specialized agentic tools for file modifications instead of fragile shell commands. It establishes a hierarchy of tools, prioritizing semantic and structural editing over raw text manipulation.

## Rules

### 1. No Shell-Based Editing
**Strictly prohibited** to use the following for editing or creating files:
- `echo`
- `sed`
- `awk`
- `printf`
- `cat > filename`
- `<<EOF` heredocs

**Why?**
- Usage of shell redaction allows for escaping issues, special character mismanagement, and encoding errors.
- It often leads to corrupt files or partial writes in complex codebases.

### 2. Tool Priority Hierarchy
You **MUST** follow this priority order when selecting a tool for file modification. Always check if a higher-priority tool can accomplish the task before moving to a lower-priority one.

#### Priority 1: Semantic & Symbolic Editing (Serena MCP)
**Use these first.** These tools respect the syntax and structure of the code (LSP-based).
- **`mcp_serena_rename_symbol`**: For renaming variables, functions, classes, etc. across the codebase.
- **`mcp_serena_insert_before_symbol`** / **`mcp_serena_insert_after_symbol`**: For inserting code relative to existing symbols (e.g., adding a method to a class).

#### Priority 2: Structured & Pattern-Based Editing (Serena MCP)
**Use these if no specific symbol is targeted.** These offer robust regex support and larger context handling.
- **`mcp_serena_replace_content`**: For replacing content using powerful regex (Python `re` syntax) or literal strings.
    - *Tip*: Use regex mode with wildcards (e.g., `start.*?end`) to safely replace blocks without quoting the entire content.

#### Priority 3: Standard Text Block Editing (Native)
**Use these for simple, contiguous text replacements** where structural tools are overkill or inapplicable.
- **`replace_file_content`**: For replacing a single contiguous block of lines.
- **`multi_replace_file_content`**: For making multiple, non-contiguous edits in a single file.

#### Priority 4: File Creation & Overwrite (Native)
**Use these for new files or when a complete rewrite is easier/necessary.**
- **`write_to_file`**: For creating new files or overwriting existing files (with `Overwrite: true`).
